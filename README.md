# DevModeCuRL
SwiftUI project to CuRL information from an endpoint from within an app 

# Intent
This project can be run as a standalone app but has no branding and is super-basic as it is intended to be used inside other apps, likely using a hidden developer mode to run arbitrary CuRL commands and get basic responses.

Supported HTTP methods include GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE. It can run anonymous or use Basic Auth, Bearer Tokens, or OAuth 2. There are also options for arbitrary headers and parameters.

The responses are not parsed but for my purposes I don't want them parsed.
